There are books, recipes, lists, and classes that get developed as open source projects.</p>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">Even if you‚Äôre a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It‚Äôs often less intimidating to work on projects that don‚Äôt involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.</p>\n\n            <br />\n            <h5>Section 3</h5>\n            <br />\n            <h4>Orienting yourself to a new project</h4>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they‚Äôll probably look at you a little strangely. Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.</p>\n\n            <h4>Anatomy of an open source project</h4>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Every open source community is different.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Spending years on one open source project means you‚Äôve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                A typical open source project has the following types of people:\n            </p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>Author: The person/s or organization that created the project</li>\n                <li>Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)</li>\n                <li>Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)</li>\n                <li>Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project</li>\n                <li>Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project‚Äôs direction</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project‚Äôs website for a ‚Äúteam‚Äù page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.\n            </p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>LICENSE: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.</li>\n                <li>README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.</li>\n                <li>CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.</li>\n                <li>CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants‚Äô behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.</li>\n                <li>Other documentation: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.</p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.</li>\n                <li>Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.</li>\n                <li>Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, ‚ÄúHow do I‚Ä¶‚Äú or ‚ÄúWhat do you think about‚Ä¶‚Äú instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.</li>\n                <li>Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <br />\n            <h5>Section 4</h5>\n            <br />\n            <h4>How to submit a contribution</h4>\n\n            <blockquote className=\"blockquote\">\n                You‚Äôve found a project you like, and you‚Äôre ready to make a contribution. Finally! Here‚Äôs how to get your contribution in the right way.\n            </blockquote>\n\n            <h4>Communicating effectively</h4>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Whether you‚Äôre a one-time contributor or trying to join a community, working with others is one of the most important skills you‚Äôll develop in open source.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Give context. Help others get quickly up to speed. If you‚Äôre running into an error, explain what you‚Äôre trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you‚Äôre suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it‚Äôd be useful to the project (not just to you!).\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Do your homework beforehand. It‚Äôs OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check a project‚Äôs README, documentation, issues (open or closed), mailing list, and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate when you demonstrate that you‚Äôre trying to learn.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Keep requests short and direct. Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how simple or helpful, requires someone else‚Äôs review. Many projects have more incoming requests than people available to help. Be concise. You will increase the chance that someone will be able to help you.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Keep all communication public. Although it‚Äôs tempting, don‚Äôt reach out to maintainers privately unless you need to share sensitive information (such as a security issue or serious conduct violation). When you keep the conversation public, more people can learn and benefit from your exchange. Discussions can be, in themselves, contributions.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                It‚Äôs okay to ask questions (but be patient!). Everybody was new to the project at some point, and even experienced contributors need to get up to speed when they look at a new project. By the same token, even longtime maintainers are not always familiar with every part of the project. Show them the same patience that you‚Äôd want them to show to you.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Respect community decisions. Your ideas may differ from the community‚Äôs priorities or vision. They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Above all, keep it classy. Open source is made up of collaborators from all over the world. Context gets lost across languages, cultures, geographies, and time zones. In addition, written communication makes it harder to convey a tone or mood. Assume good intentions in these conversations. It‚Äôs fine to politely push back on an idea, ask for more context, or further clarify your position. Just try to leave the internet a better place than when you found it.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Gathering context</h4>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your idea hasn‚Äôt been discussed elsewhere. Skim the project‚Äôs README, issues (open and closed), mailing list, and Stack Overflow. You don‚Äôt have to spend hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                If you can‚Äôt find your idea elsewhere, you‚Äôre ready to make a move. If the project is on GitHub, you‚Äôll likely communicate by opening an issue or pull request:\n            </p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>Issues are like starting a conversation or discussion</li>\n                <li>Pull requests are for starting work on a solution</li>\n                <li>For lightweight communication, such as a clarifying or how-to question, try asking on Stack Overflow, IRC, Slack, or other chat channels, if the project has one</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">Before you open an issue or pull request, check the project‚Äôs contributing docs (usually a file called CONTRIBUTING, or in the README), to see whether you need to include anything specific. For example, they may ask that you follow a template, or require that you use tests.</p>\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">If you want to make a substantial contribution, open an issue to ask before working on it. It‚Äôs helpful to watch the project for a while (on GitHub, you can click ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù to be notified of all conversations), and get to know community members, before doing work that might not get accepted.</p>\n\n            <h4>Opening an issue</h4>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">You should usually open an issue in the following situations:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Report an error you can‚Äôt solve yourself</li>\n                <li>Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)</li>\n                <li>Propose a new feature or other project idea</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">Tips for communicating on issues:</p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you‚Äôre on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.</li>\n                <li>If an issue was opened a while ago, it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.</li>\n                <li>If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <h4>\n                Opening a pull request\n            </h4>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)</li>\n                <li>Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you‚Äôve already discussed, in an issue</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                A pull request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                If the project is on GitHub, here‚Äôs how to submit a pull request:\n            </p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li>Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original ‚Äúupstream‚Äù repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from ‚Äúupstream‚Äù often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.</li>\n                <li>Create a branch for your edits.</li>\n                <li>Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, ‚ÄúCloses #37.‚Äù)</li>\n                <li>Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.</li>\n                <li>Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don‚Äôt break the existing project.</li>\n                <li>Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n\n            <br />\n            <h5>Section 5</h5>\n            <br />\n            <h4>What happens after you submit a contribution</h4>\n\n            <blockquote className=\"blockquote\">\n                You did it!
